# SyEuler App

SyEuler provides access to my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. All my solutions are developed in Swift. 

With the app, you can see the problem descriptions on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) site, view my source code on GitHub, and try out my algorithms, 

The computations run in a background thread and can be stopped if you get impatient waiting for the result.

Long running computations show a progress bar and elapsed time, so you have something to watch while you wait. Most problems run in a few milliseconds.

More information can be found on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) site.
